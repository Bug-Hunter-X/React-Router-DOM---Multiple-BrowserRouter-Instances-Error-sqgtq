```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* ... other routes */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This code causes an error because the `Routes` component must have only one parent `BrowserRouter` component. If you have multiple `BrowserRouter` components, React Router will not be able to correctly manage the routing.  This is often missed when refactoring or implementing nested routing incorrectly.
